### Welcome to sysop.ninja


Sysop.ninja is my humble attempt, to document what I do and some times, what I think. 

I work as a Linux System Administrator; playing around with different technologies, and some of them ends up being documented here. 


## [Debug Linux in 60 seconds](60s_debug.md)

So, I found this video from [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdVpKx6Wmc8), and decided to add some small notes and other examples. It's not heavily modified; just more novice-friendly, I would say 

## [Writing documentation based on rfc2119.md](rfc2119.md)

I'm trying to write better documentation; and I stumbled upon RFC2119, which I would like to use a lot more. 
Hence the reason, why I've put it at my site.

## [Upgrading Ubuntu from LTS to non-LTS](ubuntu_lts_upgrade.md) 

Just a small note to me, from me, by me (i forget these things, because i rarely use them)
