# Welcome to sysop.ninja


Sysop.ninja is my humble attempt, to document what I do and some times, what I think. 

I work as a Linux System Administrator; playing around with different technologies, and some of them ends up being documented here. 


## [Systemd reference](systemd.md)

I saw a talk from RHEL summit 2018 about systemd, and decided to make my own resum√© / TLDR / refrence-sheet. 
Feel free to use it, if it's any good to you.

## [Debug Linux in 60 seconds](60s_debug.md)

So, I found this video from [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdVpKx6Wmc8), and decided to add some small notes and other examples. It's not heavily modified; just more novice-friendly, I would say 

## [Writing documentation based on rfc2119.md](rfc2119.md)

I'm trying to write better documentation; and I stumbled upon RFC2119, which I would like to use a lot more. 
Hence the reason, why I've put it at my site.

## [Upgrading Ubuntu from LTS to non-LTS](ubuntu_lts_upgrade.md) 

Just a small note to me, from me, by me (i forget these things, because i rarely use them)

## Compile .rpm with added/new compiler flag

An article from my first blog, back in 2013. 

This is just for my own nostalgia, feel free to use it if it makes any sense.
